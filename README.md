## 1. 2  [Wireframes ](/wireframes-images/wireframes.jpg)
[See Wireframes ](/wireframes-images/wireframes.jpg)
 
These wireframes where designed  with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/x4m6WQpYOvB8l1EB9EikFm/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
which is a very instuitive prototyping tool that focuses in the user interface and user experience design.

## 1.3. Design

This website was designed using [Heroic Features](https://startbootstrap.com/template/heroic-features)
A basic Bootstrap home page template from [startboostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).
this template was chosen thinking on a minimalist 
concept which transmits serenity and tranquillity. Therefore, all pages are diaphanous but functional, avoiding the overuse of colors which could be stressful  and overwhelming for the users.
Hence, black and  white are the predominant colors. although there are some other colors such as yellow , red and blue in puntual elements as bottoms and icons. 
- The Font used was the one preset in the template:
 
font-sans-serif: system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, "Noto Sans", "Liberation Sans", sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji";
  --bs-font-monospace: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace;
